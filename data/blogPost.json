Didn't take a terriblly long time to get up and running since it's just React and I've played around with Netlify before.

Maybe later on down the line try to see how Netlify's forms work since it's top of mind right now for regular work stuff.","marks":[],"data":{}}],"data":{}}]},"slug":"something-different"}}]
