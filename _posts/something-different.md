Decided that my site needed some refreshing and I wanted to play around with a few things so here's the new site. Built with <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.JS</a> and hosted with <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. Didn't take a terriblly long time to get up and running since it's just React and I've played around with Netlify before. This initial post is just created manually in a markdown file but I might plug it into Contentful and Netlify CMS to get a feel for now a decoupled CMS + SSG works. Maybe later on down the line try to see how Netlify's forms work since it's top of mind right now for regular work stuff.
